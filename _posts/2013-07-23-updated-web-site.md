As you will have no doubt noticed, our new web site is now live! The new design is much cleaner and more modern, resulting in a site that is user friendly and easy to read.
The site is responsive, which means that it will adapt to display on different size screens, the entry on Wikipedia states:

Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones).

So you will be able to check out our website from your smartphone and tablet!
Many thanks to Chris Wharton at 2nd Floor Designs Ltd for the design and all the hard work. Over the years, I’ve worked with Chris on a few projects, if you are in need of a graphics / web designer I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him.

There are many more updates in the pipeline, stay tuned!

P.S. you can always keep up to date with what’s happening by following us on Twitter or subscribing to our RSS feed.
