Hello and welcome to the first Kanban Live blog post. I thought it would be a good idea to write an introductory blog post explaining who we are, how we got here and what we aim to achieve.

For the past few years I have been working with a number of companies, mainly within the aerospace sector, developing solutions to improve the efficiency in their supply chain. This has ranged from software that shows the past purchase history and future demand in a single page, to an RFID based system that automates the process of scanning parts bins (more on that in a future blog post). 

Through our dealings with these companies, I have to come to realise that there are a number of issues that could be addressed by taking advantage of recent developments in technology (smartphones, tablets and the reducing cost and miniaturisation of electronic components), specifically:

- preventing stock outs and line stoppages
- managing stock at remote locations
- reducing the amount of stock on hand
- connecting the shop floor to the rest of the company and supply chain

With these issues in mind, I have developed Kanban Live. My initial focus is on providing a cloud based stock management system, that uses smartphones and tablets to help you to address these issues and improve your supply chain. I have also developed some proof of concepts that automate the process of scanning inventory locations.

By using wireless sensors, a real time view on your stock levels can be achieved, with an easier installation and much improved reading range than RFID. I am looking for companies to help in the development of these sensors, if this would be of interest please let me know.

In the meantime, if you’re interested in joining the private beta for the iOS apps please drop me an email.
