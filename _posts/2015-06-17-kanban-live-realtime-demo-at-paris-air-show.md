Kanban Live is featured at the Paris Air Show this week, with a demo of the latest update to our stock control system that removes the need to have personnel physically present on-site. The working prototype is on show in Hall 2B, stand G140 with aerospace supply chain experts Spectech France.

It combines an innovative wireless device with our Kanban inventory system to give a real-time live data feed of stock levels. Suppliers can view current stock levels, scan bins remotely, and maximise or minimise component storage as needed - all using the live feed from a remote location.

The prototype currently works with Hurst Green Plastics’ Twinbins, and development is underway for compatibility with open bins and linbin systems. News of Kanban Live’s real-time system has been picked up by the aerospace press, including [AIN Online](http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aerospace/2015-06-11/tagbin-rfid-systems-now-includes-live-data-feed) and [Aero Mag](http://www.aero-mag.com/features/42/20156/3231/).

The update will undergo thorough testing and trial periods in the near future, before an open release. Spectech France are a division of The STAG Group, and provide a parts service to the aerospace and defence industries. Kanban Live has been influential in helping them win several high profile contracts in recent months.

The Paris Airshow runs from 15 – 21 June, and the Tagbin Live demo can be found at the Spechtech stand (G140 in Hall 2B). If you’re there, be sure to check it out and let us know what you think on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kanbanlive)
