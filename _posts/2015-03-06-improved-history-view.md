We recently made some changes to the history view in Kanban Live which will make it easier to see what was scanned and when. Changes of status or quantity of a single bin are viewable inline, for panel and area scans clicking on the timestamp will show more details. You may also click on the location link to navigate directly to the bin, panel or area. See the screenshot below:There have also been a few performance improvements, which is especially noticeable when viewing scans of more than 200 bins e.g. area scans.
