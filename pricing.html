            <h2 class="center">Typical sign up questions</h2>
            <div class="left questions">
                <h3>How does the 30-day free trial work?</h3>
                <p>If you sign up to a paying plan and cancel within 30 days, you won’t be charged a thing. You can cancel you account at any time, but you will be charged up for the rest of the month after your cancellation. Refunds cannot be issued after your 30 day free trial has finished.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right questions">
                <h3>Is my data secure?</h3>
                <p>We follow accepted industry standards to protect your data, both during transmission and once we receive it. All Kanban Live plans include SSL encryption to keep your data safe. We do not store your credit card information and use a secure PCI-compliant payment gateway to authorize payments.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="clearboth"></div>
            <div class="left questions">
                <h3>Do I get a 30-day free trial if I upgrade?</h3>
                <p>If you upgrade from a free account to a pay account you are not eligible for the 30-day free trial. The 30-day free trial on paying plans only applies if you sign up for a paying plan now. You can always downgrade later if you choose.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right questions">
                <h3>What web browsers work with Kanban Live?</h3>
                <p>Internet Explorer 8 and higher, Firefox 3 and higher, Safari 4 and higher, and Chrome 4 and higher.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="clearboth"></div>
            <div class="left questions">
                <h3>Can I change my plan at any time?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Simply click on the “Account” tab on your dashboard and you’ll see your options. Again, if you downgrade your plan in the middle of the month, you will be charged for the rest of that month at your current rate, until the downgrade takes affect.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right questions">
                <h3>What type of payments do you accept?</h3>
                <p>Currently we accept Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. We do not accept PayPal.</p>
                <p>
                    If you would like to prepay for 12 months you can pay with a purchase order or invoice, please

            <div class="left questions">
                <h3>Do I have to sign a long term contract?</h3>
                <p>No. Kanban Live is a pay-as-you-go service. There are no long term contracts or commitments on your part. You simply pay month-to-month. If you cancel, you’ll be billed for the current month, but you won’t be billed again.</p>
            </div>
