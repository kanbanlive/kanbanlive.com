            <h3>Simple To Use</h3>
            <p>
                When you are leading change, it's hard to get buy-in from the guys on the shopfloor - especially when your vision involves new systems and products. But give them something easier to use and it's a different story. Kanban Live's iPad and iPhone apps mean that there's a shallow learning curve with a logical, familiar and consistent control system that takes no time at all to master.

            <h3>Efficient Integration</h3>
            <p>
                Kanban Live integrates with Socket Mobile and Linea Pro barcode scannners. All your team has to do is scan stock in and out, and the system takes care of everything else. Automatic reports are sent to your MRP/ERP system to reorder stock, meaning you always remain within Just-in-time and as lean as possible. You can also use Kanban Live with a twin-bin system - perfect for high-volume, low cost parts.
